- **phpMyAdmin** (comes with XAMPP)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone or Download the Project

- If using Git, clone the repository:
  ```sh
  git clone <repository_url>
  ```
- Or download and extract the project ZIP file into the **htdocs** folder of XAMPP.

### 2. Start Apache and MySQL

- Open **XAMPP Control Panel**.
- Start **Apache** and **MySQL**.

### 3. Set Up the Database

- Open **phpMyAdmin** by visiting:
  ```
  http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
  ```
- Create a new database named **myhmsdb**.
- Click on the **Import** tab.
- Select the `myhmsdb.sql` file from the project directory and click **Go** to import it.

### 4. Configure Database Connection

- Locate the database configuration file (e.g., `config.php` or `.env`).
- Update the database credentials as needed:
  ```php
  $servername = "localhost";
  $username = "root";
  $password = ""; // Leave empty for default XAMPP setup
  $dbname = "myhmsdb";
  ```

### 5. Run the Project
